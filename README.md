Webpage is still not complete. I realized my code needs to be almost completely reformatted to accomadate the past search history buttons and make proper use of them. As of right now it will show you what you have just recently searched and add to it, but does not show it upon loading the webpage and the buttons are not currently functioning. I will need more time to complete this function and will re-submit this assignment once I have time to finish it. I apologize for the incomplete work.
